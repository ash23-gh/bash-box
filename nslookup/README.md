# Use Case

This script can be used by anyone who needs to resolve a list of hostnames to IP addresses and compare them to expected IP addresses. It can be useful for network administrators or developers working with network-related tasks.

## Steps

1. Create `host.txt` file with a list of hostnames to resolve, one per line.
2. Create `ip.txt` file with the expected IP addresses, one per line.
3. Run the script using the following command:
./IPMatchScript.sh
4. Check the `check.txt` file for any problematic IP addresses.
